  <h1>Mauris Tincidunt</h1>
  <p>  <p>  <p>Google Docs is a software that I have used and still use to do my work. I've used it throughout elementary school, and high school and I still use it in university. Google Docs is a software that allows people to edit or create documents. Google Docs is designed well since it is easy to use as the interface is very clean, user-friendly, and simple. This allows people of any skill level to use Google Docs with ease. Moreover, since Google Docs is similar to the traditional word processors, users can recall and use their skills from other editing and writing software. Furthermore, this software allows multiple users to edit and create a document together in real-time with their own separate devices. Since Google Docs can be used on any device with an internet connection, it allows users to work efficiently in groups and give suggestions and comments on their group's work without disrupting anyone’s work. It also has cloud-based access allowing users to work on their tasks even when away from their main devices for example if they work on school computers rather than their own. Moreover, Google Docs is an amazing example of why software design is very important as we can see how software design directly impacts the efficiency and accessibility of a software product as it reduces the effort required to use the software, improving productivity and the satisfaction of users. A good design will determine how well the product completes the tasks it was made to do. Furthermore, a good design also makes keeping the product up-to-date and efficient since an organized design makes it easier to update and debug the software, minimizing the cost of development. In conclusion, many advantages of software design prove its importance such as user experience, functionality and performance, collaboration and communication, and cost efficiency.</p></p></p>
  <p>The requirement gathering stage is the start up phase of a software’s development as it helps us understand what the audience and features of the software has to be. It helps us understand what the stakeholders want from the software and for what purpose we are developing it. The requirement gathering stage requires close communication and collaboration between the stakeholders and developer teams. In this stage we gather information about what the constraints are and what the objectives are for the software. The requirements gathering stage is very important for software development because it helps the developers have guidelines and a set detail for requirements they must fulfill. If this stage is done correctly it helps reduce additional costs of possible misunderstanding and project reworks which could take additional costs. It allows for a smoother development and prevents any unnecessary interruptions due to miscommunications. It allows developers to create software that satisfies the needs of the users and gives them a product that they are satisfied with and this creates loyal customers that will be willing to buy the upcoming products made by the company.

Req #1
As a student, I want the ability to create and edit documents, so that I can work on my assignments and projects.
Req #2
As a student, I want the software to allow multiple users on one document so that I can work in groups with my group members and work efficiently as a team.
Req #3
As a student I want to have cloud based access to the document so I can access my work on multiple devices and resume my work at any time. 
Req #4
As a student I want to be able to easily make tables and charts so I give good visual aspects to my projects. 
Req #5
As a student I want to be able to give comments and suggestions on the document so I can comment and suggest any changes my group members have to make without interrupting their work.

  <p>The software product is google docs and it is a software that allows people to edit or create documents. This software is used by almost everyone from grade 1 to when they are adults working in a full time job. It is used by people that want to work on projects, assignments and essays and more. The persona for a potential user that I thought of was a person working at a market agency where she works around and manages different documents for her clients projects and she works together in a group with other marketers and designers.

  <p>Communication is essential in software design and all stages of software design depend on proper communication. Firstly without communication between stakeholders and programmers, the programmers won’t know the requirements for the software which is really important since without the requirements gathering stage the software designers can not design the software. Since all the other stages of software design are based on the requirement-gathering stage, the designers can’t design a solution thus connecting back to how important communication is in software design. Three key elements of effective communication in software design are active listening, structured feedback and transparency. Actively listening means understanding each other's perspectives and requirements and making sure we are mindful, flexible, open and empathetic and pay attention to each other. Structured feedback means that feedback should be honest, positive, fair, and culturally sensitive and the feedback should be clear, constructive, and actionable. It also includes having a proper tone, body language and voice when giving feedback to ensure positive communication. Transparency means that stakeholders and team members should talk to each other regularly in each stage and be honest with each other. This builds trust and reduces misunderstandings between them. Transparency also includes having good non-verbal communication such as body movements and tone such that there are no misunderstandings. I once had miscommunication with my group members in a project where each of us did our work based on different requirements and then we had to redo it at the end. I could have handled this better by having a requirement review session where we wrote what we have to do and are doing at each stage and what tasks are required from us for the project on Google Docs so everyone could understand the requirements of the project and stay on track.</p>
  <h1>Condimentum Consequat</h1>
  <p>Software design is a process of transforming system requirements into a plan for building software. Modularity is a very important design principle that plays a very important role in software design as it is the breakdown of the system into individual modules. The individual modules can help us simplify systems and enhance maintainability by easily updating and fixing the individual modules. It also allows us to reuse the modules which can save a lot of time in the projects and it also enables the system to grow without affecting its functionality. Since modularity is an important principle of a software design, if it is not followed there are many negative effects to our system such as the increase of the time taken to update, debug and make changes to the system. When I had a car accident, the car had broken parts such as the front bumper and the lights but since these are independent modules it didn’t affect the other functionalities of the car which allowed me to drive that car to the mechanic as these parts being broken still allowed me to drive safely to the mechanic and hence allowing me to fix only the parts that were broken. This helped reduce the cost of repair for the car. Furthermore, whenever I code I always have different functions doing different tasks so for one of my projects when I had repeated syntax errors and logical errors with my calculations for base 10 expansion of a number inputted by the user, I could easily fix these errors by only making changes to the function definition of that particular independent function that worked on the base 10 expansion calculations. Hence, I didn’t have to worry about my modifications to the code affecting my code elsewhere.
