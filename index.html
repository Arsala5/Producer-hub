  <h1>Mauris Tincidunt</h1>
  <p>  <p>  <p>Google Docs is a software that I have used and still use to do my work. I've used it throughout elementary school, and high school and I still use it in university. Google Docs is a software that allows people to edit or create documents. Google Docs is designed well since it is easy to use as the interface is very clean, user-friendly, and simple. This allows people of any skill level to use Google Docs with ease. Moreover, since Google Docs is similar to the traditional word processors, users can recall and use their skills from other editing and writing software. Furthermore, this software allows multiple users to edit and create a document together in real-time with their own separate devices. Since Google Docs can be used on any device with an internet connection, it allows users to work efficiently in groups and give suggestions and comments on their group's work without disrupting anyone’s work. It also has cloud-based access allowing users to work on their tasks even when away from their main devices for example if they work on school computers rather than their own. Moreover, Google Docs is an amazing example of why software design is very important as we can see how software design directly impacts the efficiency and accessibility of a software product as it reduces the effort required to use the software, improving productivity and the satisfaction of users. A good design will determine how well the product completes the tasks it was made to do. Furthermore, a good design also makes keeping the product up-to-date and efficient since an organized design makes it easier to update and debug the software, minimizing the cost of development. In conclusion, many advantages of software design prove its importance such as user experience, functionality and performance, collaboration and communication, and cost efficiency.</p></p></p>
  <p>The requirement gathering stage is the start up phase of a software’s development as it helps us understand what the audience and features of the software has to be. It helps us understand what the stakeholders want from the software and for what purpose we are developing it. The requirement gathering stage requires close communication and collaboration between the stakeholders and developer teams. In this stage we gather information about what the constraints are and what the objectives are for the software. The requirements gathering stage is very important for software development because it helps the developers have guidelines and a set detail for requirements they must fulfill. If this stage is done correctly it helps reduce additional costs of possible misunderstanding and project reworks which could take additional costs. It allows for a smoother development and prevents any unnecessary interruptions due to miscommunications. It allows developers to create software that satisfies the needs of the users and gives them a product that they are satisfied with and this creates loyal customers that will be willing to buy the upcoming products made by the company.

  <p>The software product is google docs and it is a software that allows people to edit or create documents. This software is used by almost everyone from grade 1 to when they are adults working in a full time job. It is used by people that want to work on projects, assignments and essays and more. The persona for a potential user that I thought of was a person working at a market agency where she works around and manages different documents for her clients projects and she works together in a group with other marketers and designers.
